You've got a solid foundation for your homelab, and your focus on security is commendable! Let's break down your points and review the codebase with security and best practices in mind.
Given your high concern for security, many of these recommendations will lean towards enhancing protection, even if they involve a bit more setup.
1. Security Priorities & External Attack Surface
	• VPN (Tailscale): Excellent choice. Using Tailscale for remote access significantly reduces your direct exposure to the internet. This is a key best practice.
	• Router Port Forwarding: As outlined in your Security & Monitoring Roadmap.md, ensure no unnecessary ports are forwarded from your ASUS router to your NAS. The only ports that might need to be open to the internet are 80 and 443 for Nginx Proxy Manager to obtain SSL certificates and serve your proxied sites (if you intend them to be publicly accessible without Tailscale in the future). For now, with Tailscale, you might not need any ports forwarded.
	• Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM): (nginx-proxy/docker-compose.yml)
		○ This is your primary gatekeeper if you expose services. Keep it updated. The jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest image is convenient, but for critical services, consider pinning to a specific version and updating intentionally after reviewing changelogs.
		○ The "Block Common Exploits" option in NPM (mentioned in its README.md) is a good feature to keep enabled.
	• AdGuard Home: (adguard-home/docker-compose.yml)
		○ Uses macvlan for a dedicated IP on your LAN. This is fine. Ensure your NAS firewall and router firewall prevent external access to AdGuard Home's ports (e.g., 53 for DNS, 80/3000 for web UI) unless you specifically intend for it to be a public DNS resolver (generally not recommended for a homelab).
		○ Configuration Check: In your adguard-home/docker-compose.yml, the parent interface for macvlan is bridge0. However, the adguard-home/README.md mentions br0. Please verify the correct bridge interface name on your UGREEN NAS and ensure consistency.
2. Container Privileges (Non-Root Users)
Running containers as non-root users (Principle of Least Privilege) is a significant security enhancement.
	• Duplicati: (duplicati/docker-compose.yml)
		○ You're using PUID=1000 and PGID=10. This is good!
		○ Verify what PGID=10 corresponds to on your NAS (e.g., getent group 10). Often, user groups are 100, 1000, or similar. Ensure this group has the necessary read/write permissions for Duplicati's config volume and read permissions for backup sources (/:/nasroot:ro). Your setup.sh uses NAS_GROUP="admin". Find the GID of the "admin" group (id -g <your_admin_user>) and consider using that for PGID if it aligns with your permission model.
	• Other Services (Portainer, NPM, AdGuard Home):
		○ Portainer (portainer/docker-compose.yml): Typically runs as root to interact with docker.sock. This is a common, accepted risk. Secure Portainer's access itself with a strong password.
		○ AdGuard Home (adguard-home/docker-compose.yml): The adguard/adguardhome image might run as root. Check their documentation for official support for non-root execution or PUID/PGID variables. If not directly supported, it's more complex to change.
		○ Nginx Proxy Manager App (nginx-proxy/docker-compose.yml): The jc21/nginx-proxy-manager image. Investigate if it supports PUID/PGID or a user: directive in Docker Compose. Running the proxy itself as non-root is ideal, though it needs to bind to privileged ports (80, 443). This can sometimes be handled by using Linux capabilities (e.g., cap_net_bind_service) if the image/entrypoint supports it, or by the image internally using a root process to bind ports and then dropping privileges for the application.
	• General Recommendation: For any container image, check its documentation on Docker Hub or GitHub for PUID/PGID environment variables or a user directive. If available, use them.
// filepath: example/docker-compose.yml
services:
  some_service:
    image: some/image
    user: "1001:1001" # Replace with a dedicated non-root UID/GID
    # Or using PUID/PGID if supported by the image
    # environment:
    #   - PUID=1001
    #   - PGID=1001
    # ... existing code ...
3. Docker Host Security (docker group)
	• The setup.sh script adds NAS_USER to the docker group. This is common for convenience but grants privileges equivalent to root on the host, as a user in this group can run docker commands, including mounting host paths with write access.
	• Mitigation:
		○ Limit SSH Access: Strictly control who has SSH access to your NAS. Use strong, unique passwords or SSH keys for authentication.
		○ Rootless Docker: The most secure long-term solution is Rootless Docker, where Docker daemons and containers run without root privileges. This is more complex to set up and might have limitations or compatibility issues with your NAS OS or specific Docker images. It's something to research for the future if you want maximum host isolation.
		○ For now, be extremely cautious about who is in the docker group.
4. Secret Management
	• Using .env files (and ensuring they are in .gitignore as you've done in .gitignore) is a good practice for not committing secrets to version control.
	• The Mistia-Nexus/README.md clearly outlines their creation.
	• NPM DB Healthcheck: In nginx-proxy/docker-compose.yml, the database password is used directly in the healthcheck command: -p${DB_PASSWORD}. While within the container's context, this could potentially be visible in process lists on the host if inspected at the right moment. If the MariaDB image or mysqladmin supports reading the password from a file for the healthcheck, that would be slightly more secure. However, this is a minor point for a homelab.
	• Backup Passphrase: The verify_backup.sh script and its documentation in Mistia-Nexus/README.md regarding storing the Duplicati passphrase in ~/.duplicati_pass with chmod 600 is a good approach for cron job automation. Ensure this file is outside any Git-tracked directories.
5. Monitoring & Alerting
Your Security & Monitoring Roadmap.md is excellent.
	• Immediate Steps:
		1. Uptime Kuma (Layer 2): Deploy this. Knowing when services are down is fundamental.
		2. CrowdSec (Layer 3): Integrate this with Nginx Proxy Manager. It provides valuable intrusion detection and prevention.
	• Future Steps:
		○ Grafana + Loki + Prometheus (Layer 4): Centralized logging and metrics are invaluable for troubleshooting and deeper security insights. This is a larger undertaking but very rewarding.
6. Vulnerability Management
	• Container Image Scanning: Regularly scan your Docker images for known vulnerabilities.
		○ docker scan: (Powered by Snyk) If you have Docker Desktop or a compatible Docker CLI setup, you can use docker scan your_image:tag.
		○ Trivy: A popular open-source scanner. You can run it as a Docker container itself to scan other images.
docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v $HOME/Library/Caches:/root/.cache/ aquasec/trivy:latest image your_image_name:tag
		○ Incorporate this into your update routine (e.g., after docker compose pull in update_all.sh).
	• Host OS & NAS Firmware:
		○ Keep your UGREEN NASync firmware updated.
		○ The cron job for apt-get update && apt-get upgrade (mentioned in your roadmap) is crucial for the underlying OS if you have shell access that allows it.
	• Wazuh (Layer 5): As per your roadmap, this is a great goal for comprehensive endpoint security.
7. Review of Codebase (Scripts & Configs)
Your scripts and configurations are generally well-structured and follow good IaC principles.
	• Shell Scripts (Install, scripts):
		○ General: Good use of cd "$(dirname [Mistia-Labs](http://_vscodecontentref_/4)" for path independence and set -e for error handling.
		○ setup.sh: The Git cloning part with sparse checkout is functional. chmod +x scripts/*.sh is good.
		○ teardown.sh: Seems robust for cleaning up.
		○ update_all.sh & update.sh: The git fetch origin and git reset --hard origin/main is a direct way to sync. It will discard any local, unpushed changes in the deployment directory on the NAS. This is fine as long as all changes are intended to come from Git.
		○ verify_backup.sh: Excellent script! The trap cleanup EXIT is great. The logic for creating a canary file, backing it up, restoring, and verifying is sound.
	• Docker Compose Files:
		○ Image Tagging: Using :latest (e.g., in duplicati/docker-compose.yml) is convenient for updates via your scripts but can introduce breaking changes unexpectedly. For critical services, consider pinning to specific versions (e.g., image: lscr.io/linuxserver/duplicati:2.0.8.1_beta_20240506-0100) and updating these versions in Git deliberately. This gives you more control.
		○ Logging: Consistent use of json-file driver with rotation is good.
		○ Healthchecks: Present in most services – excellent.
		○ Networks: Isolating services in their own Docker networks (e.g., duplicati_net) is good practice.
		○ Duplicati volumes: Mounting the host root /:/nasroot:ro is necessary for Duplicati to see all files. The :ro (read-only) is crucial for security.
	• Documentation (README.md files):
		○ Your documentation is very thorough and well-written, especially the setup guides and the template for new services in the root README.md. This is a huge asset.
Summary of Key Recommendations (Actionable Next Steps):
	1. Verify AdGuard Home macvlan parent interface name (br0 vs. bridge0) and correct it in adguard-home/docker-compose.yml.
	2. Investigate and implement non-root user execution for AdGuard Home and Nginx Proxy Manager app container if their images support it (using PUID/PGID or user: directive).
	3. Review PGID=10 for Duplicati and align it with a suitable group on your NAS (e.g., the GID of your NAS_USER or admin group).
	4. Implement Uptime Kuma for service monitoring.
	5. Start using a container vulnerability scanner like Trivy or docker scan as part of your update process.
	6. Consider pinning image versions in your docker-compose.yml files for more stable and predictable updates, especially for critical services like NPM.
	7. Continue to strictly limit SSH access to the NAS and use strong credentials, given the docker group permissions.
